    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>When you want to invite someone to your house, and make a good impression, this is all you have to cook! The steps are a bit delicate, but you can do it.</p>
    <h2>Recipe:</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Brief description of ingredients of a Carbonara</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Desired pasta of choice: usually spaghetti or rigatoni.</li>
        <li>Guanciale (or cube shaped bacon if you can't find it)</li>
        <li>Eggs, one yolk for every 50g of pasta. (We won't use the whites, you can do pancakes with it :) )</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put water to boil for the pasta and prepare the guanciale by cutting it in slices and then stripes. Cook the guanciale at medium-high heat just enough to make it crunchy but not burnt.</li>
        <li>Beat the yolks in a bowl, and add the pecorino until you get a dense cream. Add the black pepper to liking, and use a bit of the fat from the guanciale to make the cream smoother.</li>
        <li>Put salt in the boiling water, then add the pasta and let it cook al dente. When the pasta is ready, take it out of the water and put it in the pan with the guanciale at low heat. After just a bit, put out the flame and add the egg sauce and mix everything.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Serve with some more pecorino and black pepper on top when plated, and you have a great carbonara to show!</p>
