    <ol>
        <li>Put some butter on a pan, make it melt at low heat and add the onion with a ts of sugar, a tbs of balsamic vinegar and a bit of salt.</li>
        <li>When the onions are caramelized, take them out and put the two burgers in the same pan where the onions were, cook them both sizes at medium-high heat and then add some wine. </li>
        <li>When the alcohol in the wine is evaporated, take out the burgers and cook some buns in the same pan, making it take the sauce that's left from the burgers.</li>
